# MineKraft

MineKraft is a Minecraft server implementation, written purely from scratch in Kotlin.

It is currently a W.I.P, so if you find any bugs, feel free to make an issue about them

### Usage

You can clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/knightzmc/MineKraft.git`
and build from source with `gradle shadowJar` if you wish to run the server.
