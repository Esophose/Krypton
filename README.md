# Krypton

Krypton is a Minecraft server implementation, written purely from scratch in Kotlin.

It is currently a W.I.P, so if you find any bugs, feel free to make an issue about them

### Usage

We now have a Jenkins CI server! You can find it at https://ci.kryptonmc.org

You can download the latest JAR file from here and run it with `java -jar Krypton-VERSION.jar`. If you have any questions,
feel free to ask in our Discord server.

Or, if you prefer, you can clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/KryptonMC/Krypton.git`
and build from source with `gradle shadowJar` if you wish to run the server.

**WARNING: Krypton is far from production ready. DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION SERVERS! WILL CONTAIN BUGS! You have been warned.**

### Contributing

Krypton is open-source for a reason. You are more than welcome to contribute, and we even encourage it. This project wouldn't
be possible without contributions.
